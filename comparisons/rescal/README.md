# Comparing to RESCAL

This directory contains code for running RESCAL on the data structures created
and used by the PRA code, for easier comparison.  The RESCAL code is found
[here](https://github.com/mnick/rescal.py).  Running code in this directory
assumes that you've downloaded that code and placed it on your `PYTHONPATH`.
